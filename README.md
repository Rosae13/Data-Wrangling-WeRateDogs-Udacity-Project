# Data-Wrangling-WeRateDogs-Udacity-Project
This project is aimed to practice the skills of data wrangling using real-world data.

Real-world data rarely comes clean, Data wrangling process consists of three parts: Gather, Assess and Clean. Real-world data rarely comes clean, so using Python and its libraries, we will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. The dataset for this project is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. We will document our wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).
